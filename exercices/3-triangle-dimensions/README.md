Exercise: Calculate and print area and perimeter of triangle
Create a program that prompts the user to enter the sides of a right triangle and then calculate and print the area and perimeter of the triangle.



The program should:



Prompt the user to enter the length of the two sides of the right triangle.

Calculate the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula base x height / 2.

Calculate the perimeter of the triangle by adding the sides.

Print the area and perimeter of the triangle to two decimal places of precision.

The program must use variables to store the sides of the triangle, the hypotenuse, the area and the perimeter. It must also use constants to represent the number of decimal places of precision desired in the output.

In addition, you must use functions from Go's Math package to calculate the square root and any other necessary mathematical calculations.



Example of input and output:

Enter side 1: 3.5
Enter side 2: 4.2
 
Area: 7.35
Perimeter: 12.20
